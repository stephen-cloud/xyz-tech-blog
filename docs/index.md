# This is the XYZ Tech Blog

There are a few things here that you might like. 

There's a series on "I'm Glad I Learned": Journeys through learning something technical. None of those is at all meant as a substitute for reference documentation. It's just about the journey.

# Who's it for?

Any software engineers as you'll need to be a bit tech-savvy. There a lots of links to the main docs for whatever we're writing about. If you're not that technical, you might find some of this a bit of a stretch. You be the judge.

You can follow our path, which might be handy for getting front of any detours. Or just scan it for help picking out an overview.
