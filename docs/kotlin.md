[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is a newish language. It's 100% compatible with Java, so we thought it was worth giving it a shot. Here's how we got good at it.

## Starting out

We already knew Java, so we didn't think we'd be in for any surprises. We were wrong. In a good way.

We started reading [the reference documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/) and tried our hand at the [Kotlin Koans](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html).

But we got bored quickly because we already know how to add numbers. Then we found a pretty opinionated [comparison of Kotlin to Java](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/comparison-to-java.html). We go bored here too. Yes, but what's it _like?_

How about the [Kotlin tutorials](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/)? We could set up [IntelliJ IDEA](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started.html#setting-up-the-environment) but that looked like a lot of steps. We didn't want to get distracted by learning IntelliJ IDEA internals. 

So we went for the [command line](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html) instead.
